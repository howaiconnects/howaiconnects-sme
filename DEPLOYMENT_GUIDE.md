# HowAIConnects Platform Deployment Guide

## Project Architecture After Separation

### Main Website (howaiconnects.com)
- **Purpose**: Marketing website, public content, lead generation
- **Routes**: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/services`, `/resources`, etc.
- **Technology**: React with public layouts
- **Target**: General audience, SEO optimization

### Web Application (app.howaiconnects.com) 
- **Purpose**: Authenticated platform with AI automation tools
- **Routes**: `/app/*`, `/dashboard`, `/account`, `/admin/*`
- **Technology**: React with protected layouts, Supabase integration
- **Target**: Authenticated users, customers, admins

## Deployment Configuration

### Option 1: Subdomain Deployment (Recommended)

**Step 1: Set up app.howaiconnects.com subdomain**
1. Go to your Lovable project settings → **Domains**
2. Click **Connect Domain** and enter: `app.howaiconnects.com`
3. Add DNS records at your domain registrar:
   - **A Record**:
     - Type: A
     - Name: app
     - Value: 185.158.133.1

**Step 2: Configure routing for subdomain**
```typescript
// In main App.tsx - Updated routing structure
const isSubdomain = window.location.hostname.startsWith('app.');

// Redirect logic based on domain
if (isSubdomain) {
  // Show only app platform routes
  routes = appPlatformRoutes;
} else {
  // Show only marketing website routes  
  routes = marketingRoutes;
}
```

### Option 2: Separate Projects (Alternative)

**Project 1: HowAIConnects Marketing (howaiconnects.com)**
- Contains only public pages
- Routes: `/`, `/about`, `/contact`, `/services`, `/resources`
- No authentication required

**Project 2: HowAIConnects App Platform (app.howaiconnects.com)**  
- Contains only app platform
- Routes: `/app/*`, `/dashboard`, `/account`, `/admin/*`
- Full authentication and Supabase integration

## Updated Routing Structure

/contact                    # Contact page
/services                   # Services overview

/account                   # User account management
/auth                      # Authentication pages
/admin/*                   # Admin panel routes
```

## Next Steps for Subdomain Deployment

### DNS Configuration
1. **Add A Record for app subdomain**:
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: app
   Value: 185.158.133.1
   TTL: Auto or 3600
   ```

2. **Wait for DNS propagation** (up to 24-48 hours)

3. **Verify SSL certificate** is automatically provisioned by Lovable

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] app.howaiconnects.com loads the application

## Benefits of This Architecture

**✅ Separation of Concerns**
- Marketing site optimized for SEO and conversions
- App platform optimized for user experience and functionality

**✅ Performance**  
- Faster loading for marketing site (no authentication overhead)
- App platform can have different caching strategies

**✅ Security**
- Authentication and sensitive data isolated to app subdomain
- Marketing site remains public and crawlable

**✅ Scalability**
- Each platform can be deployed and scaled independently
- Different update cycles for marketing vs app features

**✅ User Experience**
- Clear separation between public content and app functionality
- Professional subdomain structure (industry standard)

## Maintenance

### Updating Routes
When adding new features:
- **Marketing features** → Add to public routes
- **App features** → Add to `/app/*` routes
- **Admin features** → Add to `/admin/*` routes

### Cross-Platform Links
Use full URLs when linking between platforms:
```typescript
// From marketing site to app
<a href="https://app.howaiconnects.com/app">Launch App</a>

// From app to marketing  
<a href="https://howaiconnects.com/contact">Contact Support</a>
```

This architecture provides a clean, scalable foundation for both your marketing website and application platform!
